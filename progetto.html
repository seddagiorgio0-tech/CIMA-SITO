    <h1>CIMA Project</h1>

    <p><strong>CIMA – Crossing Into My Art – is a threshold.<br>
    A passage not necessarily toward me.</strong></p>

    <p>I travel, and the world passes through me — people, things, waits, noises, silences.
    I let myself be touched by what I encounter; sometimes I choose — a gesture, a face, a light, an ordinary thing.
    Every experience becomes living matter, part of my path.</p>

    <p>From what crosses me, traces are born — images, words, sounds.
    Sometimes Works emerge, without the presumption of being recognized as such.
    They are not trophies, nor memories fixed in place.
    They are living forms, carrying the movement of what was lived.</p>

    <p>Then comes the Story — exhibitions, texts, encounters.
    Not to explain myself, but to open a space where you, too, may enter.</p>

    <p>CIMA is not a constructed image.
    It is my nature taking shape while the world shapes me.
    For you, it is an open place — where you may pause, walk, let yourself be touched by something you might recognize, or that may surprise you.</p>

    <p><strong>If you wish — Crossing Into My Art.</strong></p>
