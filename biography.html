    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p><strong>Giorgio Sedda is an artist and explorer who develops his research through experiences lived in diverse territories and remote communities.</strong></p>

    <p>After studying visual arts — with a focus on sculpture and contemporary graphics, supported also by a Costantino Nivola scholarship — he lived and worked in several countries, intertwining artistic practice with immersion in the places he encountered.</p>

    <p>His path unexpectedly leads him to South America, where he meets an Indigenous community of the Amazon, gathering visual and narrative materials linked to rituals, the land, and the deep relationship between local populations and their environment.</p>

    <p>After settling in France, Sedda becomes an artistic ambassador for ODCVL, a cooperative engaged in social tourism. Within its artistic division, he leads the project <em>Un Monde de Couleurs</em>, bringing his lived experiences from around the world into schools and local territories, transforming them into cultural and educational tools.</p>

    <p>As part of the French project, he travels to Africa, particularly to Togo, where — after a meaningful experience in an orphanage — he creates, between France and Italy, a series of exhibitions dedicated to the lives of Togolese children, combining observation, testimony, and direct participation in the local reality.</p>

    <p>He then turns to Arctic territories: Iceland, crossed alone in winter on skis with a pulka — a highly physical and introspective journey in which he experiences solitude and freedom in extreme conditions, far from roads and cities for long stretches.</p>

    <p>This is followed by eastern Greenland, where he spends the winter living alongside the Inuit population, moving between villages also by dog sled and sharing the community’s daily life in the struggle for survival in a land that is both hostile and paradisiacal.</p>

    <p>From this trajectory emerge the first steps of <strong>CIMA – Crossing Into My Art</strong>, a project — or rather an invitation — to cross the world through his eyes: a constellation of elements nourished by his passions.</p>
