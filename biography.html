    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <img src="giorgio-biography.jpg" alt="Giorgio Sedda" class="bio-image">

    <p>
      Giorgio Sedda is an artist, explorer, and creator of the CIMA Project. His work emerges from lived experiences in remote communities, where he develops exhibitions, educational encounters, and artistic research rooted in direct participation.
    </p>

    <p>
      He has collaborated with institutions such as the Municipality of Oristano, the Centre des Monuments Nationaux (France) through ODCVL, the University and historical monuments of Épinal, and has appeared in Italian and French television segments. His photographic projects document the relationship between nature and culture, each image accompanied by a narrative text that deepens the encounter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sedda has published two editions of his project “Un monde de couleurs” with ODCVL, recounting his experiences in Africa and Iceland through reportage, artistic production, and documentation. His exhibitions have been hosted in Italy and France, including Teatro San Martino di Oristano, the municipal gallery of Épinal, and several UNESCO heritage sites.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through CIMA, he invites the public to cross into his world — a world shaped by travel without tourism, by real participation in the lives he encounters, and by artworks born from experience.
